## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2022.06.01` Update

- Even more internal smart pointers.  This includes changes to the
  `Parameters` class that may require downstream changes to match;
  compatibility in Moose itself has already been fixed.
- When trying to combine a low-order `Elem` with an incompatibly
  higher order `FE` type, the mistake is now always reported with
  comprehensible error message, even in builds with assertions
  disabled.
- When a parsed function is used and the parser returns an error, we
  now check and report details even in builds with assertions
  disabled, and we print the failing parsed expression.
- The last use of C++17-deprecated std::iterator has been fixed;
  a few compilers outside CI were giving us warnings about it.
- We put support for input meshes that themselves have holes into
  `MeshedHole`, so you can mesh with holes while your hole has holes.
- Bug fixes for some triangulator use cases.
- Support for Laplace mesh smoothing of an unpartitioned mesh.
- Compatibility fixes for some `PETSc` 3.17 configurations.
- `configure --enable-xdr-required` option to get a configure-time
  error when XDR I/O is unavailable.
- MetaPhysicL updates, for evaluating `pow(negative DualNumber,
  integer)` operations without throwing floating point exceptions,
  and also evaluating binary functions faster in general when mixing
  DualNumber and non-DualNumber parameter types.  Disable some
  MetaPhysicL optimizations when using older clang++ compilers that
  were having trouble with them.
